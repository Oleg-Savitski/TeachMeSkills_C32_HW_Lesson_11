  Write a program with the following functionality:
* Pass a string to the input (let's assume that this is some kind of standard number
the document in the specified format).
* The document number has the format xxxx-yyy-xxxx-yyy-xyxy, where x is any digit,
and y is a letter of the Latin alphabet (there can be large and small ones).

1 - Display the first two blocks of 4 digits on the screen in one line.
2 - Display the document number, but replace blocks of three letters with *** (each letter will be replaced with *).
3 - Display only one letter from the document number in the format yyy/yyy/y/y in lowercase.
4 - Display the letters from the document number in the format "Letters:yyy/yyy/y/y" in uppercase (implemented using the StringBuilder class).
5 - Check whether the document number contains the sequence "abc" and whether the message contains or not (moreover, abc and ABC are considered to be the same sequence).
6 - Check if the document number starts with the sequence 555.
7 - Check if the number ends.
